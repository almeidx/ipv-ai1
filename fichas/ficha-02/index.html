    <h2>Demonstrating a few HTML features</h2>
  </center>

  HTML is really a very simple language. It consists of ordinary text, with
  commands that are enclosed by "&lt;" and "&gt;" characters, or between an
  "&" and a ";".

  <p>
    You don't really need to know much HTML to create a page, because you can
    copy bits of HTML from other pages that do what you want, then change the
    text!
  </p>

  <p>
    This page shows on the left as it appears in your browser, and the
    corresponding HTML code appears on the right. The HTML commands are linked
    to explanations of what they do.
  </p>

  <h3>Line Breaks</h3>

  HTML doesn't normally use line breaks for ordinary text. A white space of
  any size is treated as a single space. This is because the author of the
  page has no way of knowing the size of the reader's screen, or what size
  type they will have their browser set for.

  <p>
    If you want to put a line break at a particular place, you can use the
    "&lt;br&gt;" command, or, for a paragraph break, the " &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;" command, which will insert a blank line. The heading command
    ("&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;") puts a blank line above and below the heading
    text.
  </p>

  <h4>Starting and Stopping Commands</h4>

  Most HTML commands come in pairs: for example, " &lt;h4&gt;" marks the
  beginning of a size 4 heading, and "&lt;/h4&gt; " marks the end of it. The
  closing command is always the same as the opening command, except for the
  addition of the "/".
  <p>
    Modifiers are sometimes included along with the basic command, inside the
    opening command's &lt; &gt;. The modifier does not need to be repeated in
    the closing command.
